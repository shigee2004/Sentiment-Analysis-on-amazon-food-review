This project presents a sentiment analysis framework focused on Amazon food reviews
 using the RoBERTa model, a transformer-based language model renowned for its deep
 contextual understanding. With the exponential growth of consumer reviews in e
commerce, understanding customer sentiment at scale is essential for brands to refine
 products and enhance customer satisfaction. Traditional manual analysis is impractical for
 large datasets and prone to bias, highlighting the need for automated, accurate sentiment
 classification. 
Our approach leverages RoBERTa, fine-tuned on a large dataset of Amazon food reviews, to 
classify sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative. Key preprocessing steps, including 
tokenization, stop-word removal, and handling domain-specific language, prepare the data for 
effective analysis. Model performance is optimized by tuning hyperparameters and evaluated using 
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with visualizations provided for further 
insight. 
The results demonstrate that RoBERTaâ€™s nuanced understanding of language, including sarcasm 
and informal language, enhances sentiment classification accuracy, even in complex reviews. This 
project underlines the potential of advanced NLP models to provide valuable, actionable insights 
for businesses. Future enhancements are proposed, such as integrating additional product categories
 and real-time analysis capabilities, to make this model adaptable for broader e-commerce 
applications
